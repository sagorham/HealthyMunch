The food pyramid helps to make sure that we are making healthy eating choices.  The food pyramid has six different categories: Grains, Vegetables, Fruits, Milk/Dairy, Meat and Beans, and Oils and Sweets.  Each category should be included into every meal.  It is important not to all just all fruits and vegetables, but to eat a correct amount of food from each category.  Here is a simple description of each category. 
Grains: These foods provide carbohydrates, which are an important source of energy.  Some of these foods are corn, wheat, and rice. 
Vegetables: These foods give us vitamins and minerals.  It is important to eat lots of different veggies because each one gives us different vitamins and minerals. Some of these foods are carrots, broccoli, and green beans. 
Fruits: These foods give us natural sugars, fiber, and vitamins.  Some of these foods are strawberries, bananas, and watermelon. 
Milk/Dairy: These foods are made from the milk produces from mammals.  Dairy gives our body’s calcium, protein, and Vitamins A and D.  Some of these foods are yogurt, cheese, and milk. 
Meat and Beans: These foods are normally the muscles of an animal that we eat.  Meat gives the body protein, iron, zinc, and Vitamin B12.  Some of these foods include: Fish, chicken, and eggs.  
Fats/Oils and Sweets:  These foods are in the smallest category of the food pyramid because they should only be a small part of what you eat.  These foods provide calories, but are not very nutritious.  Some of these foods are butter, candy, and pop.
